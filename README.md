# Simon Says

A browser-based memory game built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

## Project Overview

Simon Says is a classic memory game. The game flashes a sequence of colors and the player must reproduce it. With each correct attempt, the sequence grows by one - can you remember the ever‚Äëincreasing pattern?
